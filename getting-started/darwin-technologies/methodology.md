# Methodology

Darwin's methodology is built upon three core pillars: **Economic**, **Scalable, and Accessible**. These pillars function in a cyclical, interconnected manner, continuously reinforcing each other to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Darwin system.

### Economic

* **Extremely cost-efficient**: Our gasless architecture dramatically cuts costs, making decentralized computing power affordable for both organizations and individuals. This innovation democratizes access to advanced computing resources, extending their reach to a wider audience.
* **Computing Democratization**: Our distributed inference network empowers users with lower-end GPUs to actively participate in the ecosystem, breaking down barriers to entry in decentralized computing.

### Scalable

* **High Transaction Throughput**: Engineered for efficiency, our system is capable of processing a vast number of transactions, ensuring scalability to meet increasing demand.
* **Interoperability**: With full EVM compatibility, our platform ensures smooth integration across mainstream blockchain networks, enhancing cross-chain operability.
* **Horizontal Scalability**: Designed for growth, our infrastructure supports the horizontal expansion of AI nodes, allowing the network to scale effortlessly as demand increases.

### Accessible

* **Low Entry-Barriers**: Weâ€™ve eliminated the traditional barriers to participation, inviting more contributors to build and expand the blockchain and AI node network, fostering innovation and collaboration.
* **Language Diversity**: Offering a variety of SDKs (Software Development Kits) and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allows developers to choose their preferred programming languages, making it easier for them to integrate and contribute to the ecosystem.
