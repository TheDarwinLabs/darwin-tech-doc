# Methodology

Darwin's methodology is built upon three core pillars: **Accessibility**, **Stability**, and **Scalability**. These pillars function in a cyclical, interconnected manner, continuously reinforcing each other to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Darwin system.

### Accessible

* **Cost Reduction**: Significantly reduce the cost for both organizational and individual users to access decentralized computing power. This democratization makes advanced computing resources more accessible to a broader audience.
* **Eliminating Barriers**: It aims to eleminate the barrier for contributors to participate in building the blockchain and the AI node network, encouraging more participation and innovation.
* **Language Diversity**: By offering a variety of SDKs (Software Development Kits) and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), this allows developers to choose their preferred programming languages, making it easier for them to integrate and contribute to the ecosystem.

### Stable

* **High Availability and Data Consistency**: Ensure the high availability and data consistency of the blockchain.
* **Safety and Privacy**: Guarantees the protection of user information and data, ensuring that privacy and security are upheld at all times.

### Scalable

* **Horizontal Expansion**: Supports the horizontal expansion of AI nodes.
* **Interoperability**:  Ensures seamless interoperability across mainstream chains.
* **Handling High Transaction Volumes**: Designed to handle a large number of transactions efficiently, ensuring that the system can scale to meet increasing demand.
