# Methodology

Darwin's methodology is built upon three core pillars: **Economic**,  **Scalable and Accessible**. These pillars function in a cyclical, interconnected manner, continuously reinforcing each other to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Darwin system.

### Economic

* **Extremely cost-efficient**: Our gasless design significantly reduce the cost for both organizational and individual users to access decentralized computing power. This democratization makes advanced computing resources more accessible to a broader audience.
* **Computing Democratization**: Our distributed inference network allows user's with lower-end GPUs to participate in the ecosystem.

### Scalable

* **High Transaction Throughput**: Designed to handle a large number of transactions efficiently, ensuring that the system can scale to meet increasing demand.
* **Interoperability**:  With EVM-compatiblility, we ensure seamless interoperability across mainstream chains.
* **Horizontal Expansion**: Supports the horizontal expansion of AI nodes.

### Accessible

* **Low Entry-Barriers**: It aims to eliminate the barrier for contributors to participate in building the blockchain and the AI node network, encouraging more participation and innovation.
* **Language Diversity**: By offering a variety of SDKs (Software Development Kits) and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), this allows developers to choose their preferred programming languages, making it easier for them to integrate and contribute to the ecosystem.
