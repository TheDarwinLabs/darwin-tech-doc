# SoulLink

**Why we need many models** ?

* Economic Efficiency – Smaller, cultural/location specific models help reduce costs, making AI more accessible and sustainable
* Smooth Localization – autoGPT agents and AI companions (eg., c.ai, candy.ai) adapt content through model routing, easing the localization process.
* Cultural Adaption – Tailored experiences with localized models improve engagement – Japanese finetuned text-to-image for anime fans.

**What does SoulLink provide?**

SoulLink(unified AI interface) + Blockchain(unified payment) = AI World APP



**How it works?**

When a request comes in, the Language Detector will detect the language it used in the request. It will then try match the request with the best model in the current network, based on the request language and geo-location of the user. The request is then routed to that model.
