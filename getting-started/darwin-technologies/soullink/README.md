# SoulLink

SoulLink is a platform that offers a unified API for accessing a wide range of decentralized AI models, with blockchain serving as the integrated payment system. Through model localization, SoulLink powers the AI World app, enabling AI applications to scale seamlessly on a global level.

### SoulLink Components

There are three key components underlying the SoulLink platform:

* **Intelligent Routing** - Our unified API intelligently directs AI requests to the most relevant models, tailored to user preferences.
* **Diverse AI Models** - SoulLink's network features a range of models, each meticulously fine-tuned for specific languages and cultures.
* **Decentralized AI Hosting** - Our localized models leverage decentralized computing, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for AI deployment.

### **Why we need many models** ?

* **Economic Efficiency** – Smaller, culture- and location-specific models help lower costs, making AI more accessible and sustainable for users.
* **Smooth Localization** – AutoGPT agents and AI companions (e.g., c.ai, candy.ai) utilize model routing to adapt content, streamlining the localization process.
* **Cultural Adaption** – Customized experiences with localized models, such as Japanese fine-tuned text-to-image models designed for anime enthusiasts, enhance engagement.

### **How does SoulLink work?**

When a request is received, the Language Detector identifies the language used in the input. Based on this, and considering the user's geographic location, the system selects the most suitable model available within the network. The request is then routed to the chosen AI model, ensuring an optimal response for the specific language and region.
