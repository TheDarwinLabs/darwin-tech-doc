<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Asset 22@300x (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Darwin's design</p></figcaption></figure>

Darwin's ecosystem is structured into two primary components:&#x20;

1.  **Distributed AI Compute Network - a decentralized AI execution network**

    * **Components:** This includes the Query Mixer, Orchestrator, Distributed AI Inference Engine, SPECTER, and Data Availability Providers.
    * **Functionality:** Executes distributed AI inferences with a secure and verifiable workflow involving data providers and AI model executors.


2. **SoulLink - a layer that provides a unified API to a multitude of decentralized AI models**
   * **Components**: SoulLink includes the Language Detector and Request Router
   * **Functionality**: Detects the languages from the incoming inference requests and routes them to the most appropriate model in the network.
