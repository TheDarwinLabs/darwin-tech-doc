A few big tech giants dominate the current AI landscape, limiting innovation and competition. This centralization undervalues contributions from smaller AI builders and raises significant concerns about transparency and data privacy. AI remains a largely opaque "black box."

Moreover, while blockchain offers decentralization and verifiability, it faces challenges with speed and cost. Running large AI models on a blockchain is inefficient and costly. Existing solutions like ZK and FHE improve verifiability but are not yet practical for widespread decentralized AI adoption.

### What is Darwin?

Darwin introduces the Darwin Chain, a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform specifically designed for AI applications to address the systemic issues above. We aim to democratize AI development and deployment through a decentralized infrastructure that ensures security, scalability, and inclusivity.
