# ðŸ’¡ About Darwin

### What issues currently exist in the AI landscape?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Desktop - 12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The current AI landscape is dominated by a few big tech giants, limiting innovation and competition. This centralization undervalues contributions from smaller AI builders and raises significant concerns about transparency and data privacy. AI remains a largely opaque "black box."

Moreover, while blockchain offers decentralization and verifiability, it faces challenges with speed and cost. Running large AI models on a blockchain is inefficient and costly. Existing solutions like ZK and FHE improve verifiability but are not yet practical for widespread decentralized AI adoption.

### What is Darwin?

Darwin introduces the Darwin Chain, a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform specifically designed for AI applications to address the systemic issues above. We aim to democratize AI development and deployment through a decentralized infrastructure that ensures security, scalability, and inclusivity.

**Key Features:**

### How Darwin Works

Darwin's ecosystem is structured into two primary components:&#x20;

1. **EVM-Compatible L1 Blockchain:**
   * **Transaction Handling:** Darwin supports all EVM-compatible transactions and smart contracts.
   * **AI Transactions:** Darwin enables gasless AI transactions by staking its native token, DNA, to receive SDNA, which can be used to execute AI transactions for free. These transactions, inference results, and verification data are recorded on the blockchain.
2. [**Distributed AI Inference System**](../key-technologies/darwin-distributed-inference.md)**:**
   * **Components:** This includes the Query Mixer, Orchestrator, AI Executor (TEE), Distributed AI Inference Engine, SPECTER zk Transformer System, and Data Availability Providers.
   * **Functionality:** Executes distributed AI inferences securely and verifiably, involving data providers and AI model executors.
