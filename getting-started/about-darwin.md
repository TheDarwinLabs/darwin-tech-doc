# About Darwin

### What issues currently exist in the AI landscape?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Asset 29@300x (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Current AI landscape problems</p></figcaption></figure>

A few big tech giants dominate the current AI landscape, limiting innovation and competition. This centralization undervalues contributions from smaller AI builders and raises significant concerns about transparency and data privacy. AI remains a largely opaque "black box."

Moreover, while blockchain offers decentralization and verifiability, it faces challenges with speed and cost. Running large AI models on a blockchain is inefficient and costly. Existing solutions like ZK and FHE improve verifiability but are not yet practical for widespread decentralized AI adoption.

### What is Darwin?

Darwin introduces the Darwin Chain, a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform specifically designed for AI applications to address the systemic issues above. We aim to democratize AI development and deployment through a decentralized infrastructure that ensures security, scalability, and inclusivity.

**Key Features:**

### How Darwin Works

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Asset 27@300x (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>How Darwin Works</p></figcaption></figure>

Darwin's ecosystem is structured into two primary components:&#x20;

1. **EVM-Compatible L1 Blockchain:**
   * **Transaction Handling:** Darwin supports all EVM-compatible transactions and smart contracts.
   * **Glassless AI Transactions:** Darwin enables gasless AI transactions by staking its native token, DNA, to receive qDNA, which can be used to execute AI transactions for free. These transactions, inference results, and verification data are recorded on the blockchain.
2. [**Distributed AI Inference System**](../technologies/verifiable-ai-inference/)**:**
   * **Components:** This includes the Query Mixer, Orchestrator, Distributed AI Inference Engine, SPECTER, and Data Availability Providers.
   * **Functionality:** Executes distributed AI inferences with a secure and verifiable workflow, involving data providers and AI model executors.
