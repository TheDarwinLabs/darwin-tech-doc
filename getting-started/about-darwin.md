# ðŸ’¡ About Darwin

### What issues currently exist in the AI landscape?

The AI landscape is controlled by a few major tech entities, stifling innovation and competition and marginalizing contributions from the broader AI community.&#x20;

This centralized control, coupled with AI systems' opaque and unaccountable nature, raises significant concerns about data privacy, computational integrity, and the predictability of AI behavior.

### What is Darwin?

Darwin introduces the Darwin Chain, a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform specifically designed for AI applications to address the systemic issues above. We aim to democratize AI development and deployment through a decentralized infrastructure that ensures security, scalability, and inclusivity.

**Key Features:**

### How Darwin Works

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Asset 2@300x (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Darwin's ecosystem is structured into two primary components:&#x20;

1. **EVM-Compatible L1 Blockchain:**
   * **Transaction Handling:** Darwin supports all EVM-compatible transactions and smart contracts.
   * **AI Transactions:** Darwin enables gasless AI transactions by staking its native token, DNA, to receive SDNA, which can be used to execute AI transactions for free. These transactions, inference results, and verification data are recorded on the blockchain.
2. [**Distributed AI Inference System**](../key-technologies/darwin-distributed-inference.md)**:**
   * **Components:** This includes the Query Mixer, Orchestrator, AI Executor (TEE), Distributed AI Inference Engine, SPECTER zk Transformer System, and Data Availability Providers.
   * **Functionality:** Executes distributed AI inferences securely and verifiably, involving data providers and AI model executors.
