## Feature Introduction

### Blockchain Menu

Blockchain is a feature that monitors and analyzes Darwin's blockchain activity. In this feature, you can monitor and access the following information:

| Value              | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transactions       | This feature allows users to view and track individual transactions on the blockchain. You can see details such as transaction amounts, sending and receiving addresses, and types. |
| Blocks             | This feature provides access to the details of individual blocks on the blockchain, including information about the block height, miner, reward and burn fees.                      |
| Top Accounts       | This feature displays a list of the most significant or most active accounts on the blockchain, ranked balance.                                                                     |
| Verified Contracts | This feature showcases a list of smart contracts that have been verified.                                                                                                           |

### Charts & stats Menu

Charts & stats menu provides users with a comprehensive view of the blockchain metrics, such as average block time, the total number of blocks, transactions, accounts, and contracts (including deployed and verified contracts). It also shows specific data like the number of completed transactions, total Ethereum (ETH) transfers, total addresses, and total tokens.

To access this feature, click the üìä icon on the main sidebar.

### API Menu

API provides the API documentation and methods for developers to access and interact with the Darwin blockchain APIs. This menu offers the following APIs:

| API                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| REST API                  | This feature provides a traditional RESTful interface for interacting with the blockchain, allowing developers to send HTTP requests to retrieve data or perform actions on the blockchain.     |
| GraphQL                   | This feature offers a GraphQL API, allowing developers to query specific data points on the blockchain more flexibly than REST APIs.                                                            |
| RPC API (Coming Soon)     | This feature allows users to interact with the blockchain using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), a protocol for remotely executing commands on the blockchain. (This API is still in development.) |
| Eth RPC API (Coming Soon) | This feature offers an Ethereum-compatible RPC API, enabling developers to interact with the Darwin blockchain as they would with an Ethereum network. (This API is still in development.)      |

To access this feature, click the API button on the main sidebar.
