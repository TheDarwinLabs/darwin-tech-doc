To experience the Darwin Devnet network, you need Devnet tokens.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:

These tokens are solely for development purposes and hold no real value.
{% endhint %}

You can request tokens via Telegram, with a limit of one request per developer per day, and each request will provide you with 1 DNA token.

### Get the Devnet Token

1. Join the Darwin telegram group. (**Coming Soon**)
2. Send your Darwom Chain address by using the following format: `/faucet <address>.`
3. You will receive 1 DNA within a few seconds at the Darwin Chain address you provided.
