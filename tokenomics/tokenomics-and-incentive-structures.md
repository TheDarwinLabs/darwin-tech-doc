# ðŸ¤‘ Tokenomics and Incentive Structures

**Model for Staking and Inference Permissions**

Users stake tokens to obtain inference permissions, which are represented as specific tokens that can be used to execute AI operations within the Darwin system without incurring transaction fees.

**Mathematical Representation:** \[ P = S \times \alpha ] Where:

* ( P ) = Number of inference permission tokens generated
* ( S ) = Amount of native tokens staked by the user
* ( \alpha ) = Conversion factor from staked tokens to inference permissions

This model allows users to utilize the AI services economically, promoting active participation and sustained usage of the platform.

#### Revenue Generation and Distribution

**Fee Structure and Revenue Flow**

Application builders pay in USD to use the inference services for building applications. These fees contribute to the revenue pool, which is distributed to stakeholders who stake tokens.

**Revenue Distribution Model:** \[ R = F \times \beta ] Where:

* ( R ) = Revenue distributed to stakers
* ( F ) = Total fees paid by application builders
* ( \beta ) = Percentage of fees allocated to stakers

This structure ensures that contributors who secure and sustain the network through staking are rewarded with a share of the revenue generated from the platformâ€™s operational activities.

#### Block Reward Distribution

**Allocation of Block Rewards**

The Darwin system, operating on an L1 blockchain, generates block rewards that are allocated to various participants, including relayers, computational resources providers, and orchestrators, ensuring all contributing roles are incentivized.

**Block Reward Allocation Function:** \[ B\_i = (W \times \gamma\_i) ] Where:

* ( B\_i ) = Block reward for participant ( i )
* ( W ) = Total block reward generated
* ( \gamma\_i ) = Proportional allocation factor for participant ( i )

This formula facilitates a fair and transparent distribution of rewards, aligning the interests of network maintainers with the overall health of the blockchain.

#### Economic Security and Sustainability

To ensure the long-term viability of the Darwin platform, the tokenomics are designed to balance the supply and demand of tokens, control inflation, and adjust reward mechanisms dynamically based on network performance and economic conditions.

**Adaptive Economic Model**

The Darwin platform may adjust ( \alpha ), ( \beta ), and ( \gamma ) values in response to fluctuations in network activity, token velocity, and market conditions to maintain economic balance and encourage continued participation.
