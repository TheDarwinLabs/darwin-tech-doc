# FAQ

1. **What is the hybrid gas model?**&#x20;

Our blockchain utilizes a hybrid gas model that combines traditional gas fees for normal transactions with a point-based system for AI usage. This means that while standard transactions incur gas fees, AI-related transactions can be processed gasless, reducing users' costs and encouraging wider adoption.

2. **Why is the platform particularly beneficial for Web2 users?**&#x20;

The platform is designed to lower the entry barriers for mass adoption among Web2 users by simplifying the onboarding process, reducing costs, and providing a more efficient and secure environment for AI applications. This approach makes it easier for users accustomed to Web2 interfaces and functionalities to transition to Web3 technologies.

3. **Why is the blockchain built as a Layer 1 solution?**&#x20;

Building as a Layer 1 solution allows us to tailor the blockchain specifically to the needs of decentralized AI operations without the constraints of underlying AI Layer blockchains. This flexibility enables us to implement unique features like our hybrid gas model and specialized consensus mechanisms that would be challenging to integrate at the Layer 2 level.

4. **How does the platform ensure the security of AI transactions?**&#x20;

The platform employs zero-knowledge proofs within its consensus mechanism to ensure that AI computations and inferences can be verified without revealing any underlying data. This approach enhances the privacy and security of AI transactions across the network.

5. **What are the expected impacts of these innovations on the blockchain industry?**&#x20;

By integrating advanced AI operational capabilities and zero-knowledge proofs into a Layer 1 blockchain, we anticipate setting new standards for security and efficiency in blockchain technology. This could lead to broader adoption of blockchain solutions across various industries, particularly those requiring robust data privacy and computational efficiency.

6. **What is the Darwin SPECTER?**

SPECTER is Darwinâ€™s Game-Theoretic Mixer, which enhances privacy by mixing transactions, making it difficult to trace the origin of transactions on the network. For more information regarding the SPECTER, see [here](../getting-started/darwin-technologies/darwin-ai-compute-network/darwin-specter.md).

7. **What is the DNA token, and how is it used in Darwin?**

DNA is the Darwin network's native utility token. It is used for various functions, including transaction fees, staking, governance, and incentivizing AI Node operators.

8. **How can I participate in the Darwin network as a developer?**

Developers can participate by building and deploying AI models on the Darwin network, contributing to the AI Node infrastructure.
