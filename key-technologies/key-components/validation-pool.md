# Validation Pool

**Role and Mechanism**

The Validation Pool is crucial for maintaining the integrity of AI computations. It verifies the correctness and reliability of the results produced by AI models before they are finalized on the blockchain. This component uses a combination of traditional validation techniques and innovative approaches like zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the security and accuracy of validations.

**Interaction with Indexer**

The Indexer works in tandem with the Validation Pool to efficiently manage and query the data involved in AI tasks. It optimizes the retrieval of information necessary for validation processes, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system.
