# User Interaction

**Stake Management**

Users engage with the Darwin platform primarily through staking mechanisms. Staking not only secures and validates blockchain operations but also determines the eligibility for participating in certain AI tasks, voting on governance decisions, and receiving rewards.

**AI Requests and Responses**

Users submit AI requests via the platformâ€™s interface, which are then processed by the distributed network of AI nodes. The system ensures that responses are accurate, timely, and secure, leveraging the underlying blockchain and AI technologies to maintain integrity and privacy.

**Relayer RPC Service**

The Relayer RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service acts as the intermediary that facilitates communication between users and the blockchain. It handles the submission of AI requests and the retrieval of results, ensuring smooth and efficient user interactions with the platform.
