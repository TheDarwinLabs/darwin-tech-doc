# Step 3: Retrieve Streaming AI Results from the Query Mixer

After successfully signing and submitting your AI transaction, the next step involves retrieving the AI-generated results from the Query Mixer. This step is crucial for accessing real-time, streaming responses generated by AI nodes based on the input provided. Hereâ€™s how to efficiently query and receive streaming results from the Darwin AI blockchain's Query Mixer.

**Setting Up to Receive Streaming Responses**

1.  **Querying the Query Mixer**:

    * To retrieve the results, you'll need to make a request to the Query Mixer using the unique `requestId` associated with your transaction. This ID was generated during the transaction submission and is essential for fetching the corresponding results.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://query-mixer.darwin.example.com/results?requestId=1" -H "Accept: text/event-stream"
    ```

    * Note the header `"Accept: text/event-stream"`; this is crucial for establishing a streaming connection. It tells the server that the client is prepared to handle streaming data as it becomes available.
2. **Handling the Stream**:
   * When you request streaming data, the server will keep the connection open and send updates in real-time as they are processed by the AI nodes.
   * Each data packet received from the server will contain a portion of the AI's response, allowing the client to process or display the information incrementally.
